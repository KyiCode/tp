# OfferFlow User Guide

## 🎯 For the Internship-Hunting CS Student

Let's be honest applying for internships can be a nightmare. Between grinding LeetCode questions, projects and actually attending classes, tracking internship applications can itself become a full-time job.

Hence, **OfferFlow** was built by CS students by CS students as we understand the struggle. OfferFlow is a desktop app that helps you:
- Track every internship application without the spreadsheet and calender reminder chaos
- Update and moniter application statuses in seconds unlike spreadsheet which can be very time-consuming
- Keep all your opportunities organised with minimal overhead!

If you can type fast, OfferFlow will manage your internship pipeline faster than any GUI-focused application!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your OfferFlow.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar OfferFlow.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all internship applications.

   * `add n/Google p/96789012 e/google@gmail.com a/70 Pasir Panjang Rd, #03-71 d/2024-06-18 r/Backend Developer s/interviewed t/java` : Adds your internship application to Offerflow.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all applications.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Google`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Google t/java` or as `n/Google`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/java`, `t/java t/React` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, OfferFlow will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause OfferFlow to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous OfferFlow home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Glossary

1. **GUI:** Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a visual way to interact with a computer, using icons, menus, and pointers rather than typed commands.
