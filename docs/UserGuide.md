# OfferFlow User Guide

## 🎯 For the Internship-Hunting CS Student

Let's be honest applying for internships can be a nightmare. Between grinding LeetCode questions, projects and actually attending classes, tracking internship applications can itself become a full-time job.

Hence, **OfferFlow** was built by CS students by CS students as we understand the struggle. OfferFlow is a desktop app that helps you:
- Track every internship application without the spreadsheet and calender reminder chaos
- Update and moniter application statuses in seconds unlike spreadsheet which can be very time-consuming
- Keep all your opportunities organised with minimal overhead!

If you can type fast, OfferFlow will manage your internship pipeline faster than any GUI-focused application!

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.`<br>`
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your OfferFlow.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar OfferFlow.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.`<br>`
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all internship applications.
   * `add n/Google p/96789012 e/google@gmail.com a/70 Pasir Panjang Rd, #03-71 d/2024-06-18 r/Backend Developer s/interviewed t/java` : Adds your internship application to Offerflow.
   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   * `clear` : Deletes all applications.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**`<br>`

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.`<br>`
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Google`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.`<br>`
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Google t/java` or as `n/Google`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.`<br>`
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/java`, `t/java t/React` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.`<br>`
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.`<br>`
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous OfferFlow home folder.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

## Glossary

1. **GUI:** Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a visual way to interact with a computer, using icons, menus, and pointers rather than typed commands.
